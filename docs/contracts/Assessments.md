# Assessments

## Overview

The `Assessment` contract manages the evaluation over cover claims. Each cover product type has an assigned assessor group responsible for evaluating all claims submitted under that product type. The assessors within an assessor group are trusted and vetted industry professionals, approved by the Advisory Board.

Each assessor has the responsibility to evaluate the cover claims and cast their votes to approve / deny the claim. A majority in favour needs to be met to approve a claim.

## Key Concepts

### Assessment

An **Assessment** is a voting process initiated when a claim is submitted to determine its validity.

- `assessingGroupId`: Group ID of the assessor group responsible for this assessment
- `cooldownPeriod`: The amount of time (seconds) the claimant needs to wait after the voting period ends before they can redeem the claim payout if the claim was approved
- `start`: Timestamp when the assessment began
- `votingEnd`: Timestamp when the assessment voting period ends
- `acceptVotes`: Total votes in favor.
- `denyVotes`: Total votes against.

### Assessor group

Each cover product type has an assigned assessor group responsible for evaluating all claims submitted under that product type

### Assessment Timeline

1. Claim is submitted
2. Voting period (72 hours): starts after claim submission
3. Cooldown before payout: starts after voting period ends
     - The Advisory Board uses the cooldown period to review for any potential fraud
4. Redemption period: starts after cooldown period ends. The time window during which a claimant can withdraw their payout

### Voting

* each assessor has a vote weight of 1
* only the votes actually cast are counted
* if no ones votes against and the voting period ends, a single accept vote is enough to approve the claim

### ETH Deposit & Voting Outcome

- Claimants are required to deposit 0.05 ETH when submitting a claim
- if majority of the votes cast on `accept`, the claim is approved
  - claim is paid out and the claim deposit is refunded back to the claimant
- if majority of the votes cast on `deny`, the claim is rejected
  - claim is NOT paid out and the claim deposit is NOT returned to the claimant
- if its a draw, the claim is rejected but the claimant can retrieve their claim deposit and try
  - claim is NOT paid out but the claimant can retrieve their deposit back

### Fraud Resolution

- If fraudulent votes are detected, the Advisory Board can step in an intervene before the claims results are finalized
- The Advisory Board has the powers to:
  - pause Assessments and Claims contract
  - undo fraudulent votes
  - remove fraudulent assessors
  - extend assessment voting period before cooldown period ends
