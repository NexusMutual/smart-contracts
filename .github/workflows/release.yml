# Release Workflow
#
# This workflow is responsible for creating and publishing stable releases to npm
# with the '@latest' tag when changes are pushed to the master branch.
#
# Workflow Behavior:
# - Triggered on push to master branch
# - Checks if commits since the last tag triggers a version bump using conventional commits
# - If a version bump is triggered:
#   - creates a version bump commit on both root package.json and deployments/package.json
#   - creates a git tag
# - Publishes the package to npm with the '@latest' tag
# - Creates a git tag and GitHub release with release notes
# - Rebases the release-candidate branch to ensure it stays in sync with master
#
# Scenarios:
# 1. Release candidate merged to master with commits that trigger a version bump:
#    - Workflow determines the next semantic version (e.g., 0.2.0 from 0.1.0)
#    - Creates a version bump commit in package.json files
#    - Publishes the new version to npm with '@latest' tag
#    - Creates a git tag and GitHub release with release notes
#    - Rebases release-candidate branch to sync with master
#
# 2. Push to master with commits that don't trigger a version bump:
#    - Workflow fails with an error message
#    - No version is published, no tag is created
#    - Ensures only meaningful changes result in new releases
#    - Still rebases release-candidate branch to ensure it stays in sync with master
# 
# Note: The rebase-release-candidate job always runs (if: always()) to ensure
# release-candidate branch is always in sync with master, regardless of whether
# the release process succeeds or fails.
