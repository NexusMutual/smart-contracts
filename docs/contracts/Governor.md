# Governor

## Overview

The Governor contract allows creating, voting and executing proposal passed within the Nexus Platform.

The Advisory Board (AB) can create proposal with arbitrary system actions to determine the direction of the Mutual.

On the other hand mutual members cannot propose arbitrary actions but maintain control over who serves on the Advisory Board.

## Key Concepts

### Proposal Types

* **Advisory Board (AB) proposals**
  * raised and voted on by AB members
  * can contain arbitrary actions to be executed by the Governor contract
* **Member proposals**
  * limited to proposing changes to the Advisory Board (AB) seats
  * raised and voted on by members

### Voting

* **Advisory Board (AB) proposals**
  * each AB member has vote weight of 1
* **Member proposals**
  * token weighted votes, capped at 5% supply vote per member
  * voting locks member tokens until proposal executing deadline

### Threshold

* **Advisory Board (AB) proposals**
  * each AB member has vote weight of 1
  * passes if the proposal receive â‰¥ 3 supporting votes
* **Member proposals**
  * must have >= 100 tokens to raise AB swap proposal
  * at least 15% of total token supply must participate in the proposal
  * passes if supporting votes > against votes

### Proposal Timeline

* **Proposal Creation** - proposal is created
* **Voting Period (3 days)** - proposal is voted on
* **Timelock (1 day)** - cooldown before executing actions
* **Execution** - proposal actions can be executed after timelock
