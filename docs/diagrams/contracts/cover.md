## Actions

### Quick Summary:

1. Members receive a Cover NFT as proof when purchasing cover
2. AB Members manage products

### 1. Member Actions

1. **Buy Cover**
   (1a) **Member** calls `buyCover` on Cover with:
   - Product ID
   - Cover amount
   - Cover period
   - Payment asset
   - Cover asset
     (1b) **Cover** validates product with CoverProducts
     (1c) **Cover** mints NFT representing cover
     - issues Cover NFT to buyer
       (1d) **Cover** processes payment via Pool

### 2. Advisory Board Actions

1. **Product Configuration**
   (1) **AB Member** calls `setProducts` on CoverProducts to:

   - Add new products (`productId = uint256.max`)
   - Update existing products
   - Set initial price ratios
   - Set capacity reduction ratios
   - Configure allowed staking pools

   (2) **AB Member** calls `setProductTypes` on CoverProducts to:

   - Define product types (`productTypeId = uint256.max`)
   - Set grace periods
   - Set product type names
   - Update product type metadata

   (3) **AB Member** calls `setProductsMetadata` to:

   - Update product IPFS metadata
   - Update product type IPFS metadata

## Notes

- Cover NFTs represent ownership of cover policies
- Products must be configured before they can be purchased
- Cover periods have minimum (28 days) and maximum (365 days) durations
- Products can be deprecated which prevents new cover purchases
- Products can be restricted to specific staking pools
- All contracts fetch latest addresses from NXMaster Registry
- Product metadata is stored on IPFS with timestamps
- Initial price ratio must be above product minimum price

## Registry Dependencies

All contracts fetch latest contract addresses from NXMaster:

- CoverProducts: P1 (Pool), CO (Cover), MR (MemberRoles), SP (StakingProducts)
- Cover: P1 (Pool), TC (TokenController), MR (MemberRoles), CP (CoverProducts)
- CoverNFT: Operator address
