# Claims

## Overview

The `Claims` contract enables cover owners to **submit claims** and **redeem payouts** if their claim are accepted.

Claims go through an assessment process where an assigned assessing group votes whether to approve or deny a claim. The assessors within this assessing group are trusted and vetted industry professionals, approved by the Advisory Board.

## Key Concepts

### Claims Timeline

1. Claim is submitted with the cover grace period
2. Assessment voting period (72 hours): starts after claim submission
3. Cooldown before payout: starts after assessment voting period ends
4. Redemption period: starts after cooldown period. the claimant can withdraw their payout on an approved claim within this period
   - If not redeemed in time: The payout expires and **cannot be claimed**

### Grace Period

Each cover product type has a defined grace period which determines the time window during which a claimant can submit a claim.

### ETH Deposit

Claimants are required to deposit 0.05 ETH when submitting a claim

### Claim Status

1. **VOTING:** The claim is submitted and under assessment voting
2. **COOLDOWN:** During this period the assessment votes are reviewed for any fraud
3. **FINALIZED:** The assessment outcome is finalized

### Claim Outcome

1. **PENDING:** The claim is still under assessment (no outcome yet)
2. **ACCEPTED:** The claim has been approved
   - the claimant can redeem payout if its within the redemption period
   - the claim deposit is refunded back to the claimant
3. **DENIED:** The claim has been rejected
   - no payout
   - claim deposit is NOT returned to claimant
4. **DRAW** no majority vote reached
   - no payout
   - the claimant can retrieve their deposit back by calling `retrieveDeposit`
